# Dairon's Website

My personal Website at [https://www.dairon.org](https://www.dairon.org).

Powered by [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and hosted on Github pages.

## Development

Install Erlang and Elixir with [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/):

```bash
asdf install
```

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
mix deps.get
```

To compile the pages run:

```bash
mix compile
```

Start the local development server with:

```bash
mix dairon.server
```

**Voilà!** Now you can visit the website from your browser in the printed port 🎉.
