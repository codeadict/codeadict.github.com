# Dairon's Website

My personal Website at [https://www.dairon.org](https://www.dairon.org).

Powered by [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and hosted on Github pages.

## Development

Install dependencies with [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/):

```bash
asdf install
```

To compile the pages run:

```bash
mix compile
```

Start the local development server with:

```bash
iex -S mix
```

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
