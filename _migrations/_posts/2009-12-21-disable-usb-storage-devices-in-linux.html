For security reasons, mainly in school are completely disabling USB storage devices on the computers at lab.  It is important because students can bring  a virus or also can leave with any private information. There is an easy way to do it in linux blacklisting the kernel driver:
<ol>
	<li>Open <strong>/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf </strong> file.</li>
	<li>Type that line at end of file<strong> blacklist usb-storage</strong>.</li>
</ol>
Now nobody can use a USB memory stick in that computer. To enable it again comment or delete that line.
