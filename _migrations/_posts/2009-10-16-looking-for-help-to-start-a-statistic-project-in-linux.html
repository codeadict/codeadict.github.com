Hello to all the linux comunity, im looking forward to start a new project. It consist in a statistic application with a nice GUI like Statistic or StatGraph in Windows enviroment, i think there is not a good visual statistic program for linux and users that work with statistic programs in Windows have dificulties to migrate to Linux. GNU R is a powerfull statistic program, i will make my project based on R using python R(http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2.html) and GTK2 toolkit. Please all the people interested in collaborate with code , artwork and ideas contact me please.
