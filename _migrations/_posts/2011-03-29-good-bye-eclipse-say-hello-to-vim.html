Keeping on my hard search for a professional an lightweight IDE for my Linux box i have finally decided for <a href="http://www.vim.org">VIM</a>(VI Improved). It have 34 years of continuous development and is powerfull and stable. I haved used Eclipse for years but i never have been so happy with it due to its great memory consuming and my computer is a Pentium M with only 512 MB of RAM. I have found VIM some time ago on the internet but i thinked it is very hard, thats an erroneus idea, some time ago i decided switch and everything goes nice. I think i have lot of triks to learn still but now i see it better than Eclipse(In my opinion) due to its powerfull customization features and shocuts that prevent from loosin time giving click to do most operations. For now im using VIM for web and Open ERP development. It use is better and better while more you learn.

Vim basically works on 2 modes that can be switched by ESC key(That is my config mapping). The Insert mode is for editing text and the command mode for making operation on text by shorcuts or commands. I think is better work on basic mode to learn it and add more features as you learn. My current configuration includes:
<ul>
	<li>File explorer</li>
	<li>HTML editing features with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/wiki/ZenHTMLSelectorsEn">ZEN Coding</a> plugin</li>
	<li>PHP debugging with Xdebug</li>
	<li>Code completion</li>
	<li>PHPDoc Support</li>
	<li>VCS Support(Mercurial and BZR)</li>
</ul>
Reggards to all visitors and any question please contact me on comments and i will respond soon. On future post i will write about features and tricks im going discovering on VIM.Vim is very documented online and on editor help itself. Here you can check a few links:
