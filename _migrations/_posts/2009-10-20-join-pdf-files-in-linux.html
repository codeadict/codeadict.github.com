Hello linux users: in this post i will show how to join two or more PDF files into one. You have to install the Ghostscript driver to do that, typing in a terminal(is for Debian and Ubuntu):

<strong>apt-get install gs
apt-get install pdftk

</strong>Now<strong> </strong>we join the PDFs with this command:

<strong>gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=unidos.pdf  file1.pdf  file2.pdf
</strong>

Here is the explanation of command:
<strong>gs:</strong> Call to the Ghostscript program.
<strong>-dBATCH:</strong> Close the Ghostscript when terminate the process.
<strong>-dNOPAUSE:</strong> Dont pause the program to aks for user interaction.
<strong>-q: </strong>Dont show messages during the process.
<strong>-sDEVICE=pdfwrite:</strong> Use Ghostscript PDF generator to do the process.
<strong>-sOutputFile=unidos.pdf:</strong> The name of the result file.

You can also join all PDF files in a directory typing *.pdf.
