Who am I & what have I done? Contact information.

![Me](/imgs/me.jpeg){: .photo }

Howdy, I’m Dairon. I'm a programmer and [consultant](https://redclawtech.com) based in Florida, USA. I've been building software for over 15 years . Remote worker since the dialup days.

Over the years I've worked on a wide range of projects, from message brokers to ERPs and web applications, from small startups (Gooee, System76, BlockFi) to large corporations like Cisco or Baxter.

This website is supposed to be part portfolio, part rambling space. A place where I’ll try show my skills and projects. I’ll also try to write about things I find interesting. Posts here and elsewhere on the Internet do not represent the views of my employers (past, present, or future) _unless explicitly stated_.

## Bio

I was born in the 1980s in a farm in the [middle of nowhere](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gZKavZVFHid5BrHv7) in Cienfuegos, Cuba. As a kid, I used to dissasemble old Soviet radios and was always amazed to discover what was inside. I became the neighborhood _"electronics technician"_ of these machines who always had too many leftover parts :). At the age 14 I touched a computer for the first time and was hooked. I started learning how to program in BASIC and Pascal and was fascinated by the idea of creating something out of nothing and make people's job easier.

I went to a vocational school to study electronics and computer science and later to university to study Telecommunications Engineering which I dropped in third year to escape the country. I lived in Ecuador for a few years and then moved to the US where I've been living since 2016.

Aside from computers I like traveling, cooking, baking bread, and gardening/permaculture.
