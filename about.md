Welcome stranger!

My name is Dairon(/Daɪron̩/) Medina. This is my personal website.

Somewhere herein, you'll find things that interest me, things I'd like to share with the Internets, and things I'd like to remember at some point in the future. This site is, however, more for myself than you.

I grew up in a farm "near" [Cienfuegos, Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cienfuegos) and have been living in South America, Florida and now in Raleigh, North Carolina.

I love Technology and like to loose my time investigating and playing with different programming languages since i was 14 years old. I hack mostly with Python, Django, Erlang, Linux and trying to learn as much as I can about functional programming languages. I have a "real job" for a living and really enjoy the remote/nomad lefestyle instead of the 8 to 5 office.

Aside from computers I like road trips, hiking, biking and anything out there in the nature.

### My open source projects
