Hi there! My name is Dairon(/Daɪron̩/), and I'm a Cuban software engineer living in sunny Florida. I use to hack mostly with Python, Erlang, Linux and other daemons. 
I've been playing around with computers since i was 14 and have played with many technologies during the time. 
I am a Free Software and Open Source advocate and my main interests are concurrent programming and real-time technologies.


### My open source projects
